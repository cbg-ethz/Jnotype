# Workflows

This directory presents workflows associated with different publications.

Note that as the package evolved, some workflows may have been deprecated.
To rerun the analysis, it's then important to rewind the changes to the right point in the `git` history.
This can be done by:

```bash
$ git checkout tags/TAG_NAME
```

where `TAG_NAME` represents the right point in time for a particular project.
